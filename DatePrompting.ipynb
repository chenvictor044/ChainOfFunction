M, D, and Y are the Month, Day, and Year as an integer, respectively. n is the number of Years/Months/Days that you want to increment/decrement by. For example, if you wish to find the date 2 months after May 13th, 1973, you would perform the action incMonth[5, 13, 1973, 2]. Terminate your response after an action. Then, an Observation is returned by the user. You will be given a question and you will perform Thoughts and Actions until you get the answer. When you get the answer, you will perform the Action called Finish and write Finish[answer]. While you are reasoning out solutions, ensure that you continually refer back to relevant parts of the question and employ logical reasoning to determine your next action.\n",
      "Question: Tomorrow is 11/12/2019. What is the date 24 hours later in MM/DD/YYYY?\n",
      "Thought: If tomorrow is 11/12/2019, then today is 11/11/2019. The question asks for the date 24 hours later, which is the same as saying the date the next day. Therefore, I need to find the date one day after 11/12/2019. \n",
      "Action: incDay[11;12;2019;1]\n",
      "Observation: 11/13/2019\n",
      "Thought: So the date 24 hours later is 11/13/2019. \n",
