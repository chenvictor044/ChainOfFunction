M, D, and Y are the Month, Day, and Year as an integer, respectively. n is the number of Years/Months/Days that you want to increment/decrement by.

    "There are 7 types of actions: \n",
    "(1) CREATE_START[data]CREATE_END: CREATE takes a data definition of a table which will be used to generate a pandas dataframe, so make sure that the input does not contain anything unnecessary for the pandas dataframe input generation. Write the data in json format. For example, to create a table for the above example, you would write: CREATE_START[{\"name\": [\"Louis\", \"Bernard\", \"Vincent\", \"Gwen\"], \"age\": [7, 5, 9, 8], \"height\": [50, 80, 60, 70], \"weight\": [11, 13, 11, 15]}]CREATE_END\n",
    "(2) GET_VALUE_START[row_number;column]GET_VALUE_END: GET_VALUE takes the row_number, e.g., 0 is the 1st row of the table, and the name of a column, e.g., age, and returns the value of the cell, e.g., the age in the first row of the table. For example, to get the age in the first row of the table, you would rate GET_VALUE_START[0;age]\n",
    "(3) COUNT_START[query]COUNT_END: COUNT takes a query and counts the number of entries in the table that satisfies the query. For example, COUNT_START[age > 5]COUNT_END would count the number of entries whose value in the column \"age\" is larger than 5.\n",
    "(4) FILTER_START[query]FILTER_END: FILTER takes a query, similarly to COUNT, and filters the entries in the table that satisfies the query. For example, FILTER_START[height < 13]FILTER_END would return the entries whose value in the column \"height\" is less than 13.\n",
    "(5) SORT_START[column]SORT_END: SORT takes the name of a column in the table and sorts the table based on the column in lexicographical/numerical order. For example, in the above table, SORT_START[age]SORT_START would sort the table from the youngest penguin to the oldest penguin.\n",
    "(6) ADD_START[row]ADD_END: ADD takes a row and adds it to the table. Write the data in json format. NOTE: This does not necessarily preserve any previous sorted order. For example, to add a penguin named Jack, age 8, height 52 cm, and weight 18 kg, you would write ADD_START[{\"name\": \"Jack\", \"age\": 8, \"height\": 52, \"weight\": 18}]ADD_END\n",

For example, to create a table for the above example, you would write: CREATE_START[{\"name\": [\"Louis\", \"Bernard\", \"Vincent\", \"Gwen\"], \"age\": [7, 5, 9, 8], \"height\": [50, 80, 60, 70], \"weight\": [11, 13, 11, 15]}]CREATE_END\n",

      "(1) CREATE_START[data]CREATE_END: CREATE takes a data definition of a table which will be used to generate a pandas dataframe, so make sure that the input does not contain anything unnecessary for the pandas dataframe input generation. Write the data in json format. For example, to create a table for the above example, you would write: CREATE_START[{\"name\": [\"Louis\", \"Bernard\", \"Vincent\", \"Gwen\"], \"age\": [7, 5, 9, 8], \"height\": [50, 80, 60, 70], \"weight\": [11, 13, 11, 15]}]CREATE_END\n",
      "(2) GET_VALUE_START[row_number;column]GET_VALUE_END: GET_VALUE takes the row_number, e.g., 0 is the 1st row of the table, and the name of a column, e.g., age, and returns the value of the cell, e.g., the age in the first row of the table. For example, to get the age in the first row of the table, you would rate GET_VALUE_START[0;age]\n",
      "(3) COUNT_START[query]COUNT_END: COUNT takes a query and counts the number of entries in the table that satisfies the query. For example, COUNT_START[age > 5]COUNT_END would count the number of entries whose value in the column \"age\" is larger than 5.\n",
      "(4) FILTER_START[query]FILTER_END: FILTER takes a query, similarly to COUNT, and filters the entries in the table that satisfies the query. For example, FILTER_START[height < 13]FILTER_END would return the entries whose value in the column \"height\" is less than 13.\n",
      "(5) SORT_START[column]SORT_END: SORT takes the name of a column in the table and sorts the table based on the column in lexicographical/numerical order. For example, in the above table, SORT_START[age]SORT_START would sort the table from the youngest penguin to the oldest penguin.\n",
      "(6) ADD_START[row]ADD_END: ADD takes a row and adds it to the table. Write the data in json format. NOTE: This does not necessarily preserve any previous sorted order. For example, to add a penguin named Jack, age 8, height 52 cm, and weight 18 kg, you would write ADD_START[{\"name\": \"Jack\", \"age\": 8, \"height\": 52, \"weight\": 18}]ADD_END\n",
