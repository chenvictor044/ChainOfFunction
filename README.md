**Chain of Function (CoF)**\
This is the code and datasets for my research on Chain of Function (CoF). The datasets folder contains the various datasets used for testing the implementation of CoF. The Jupyter notebooks are each an implementation of CoF for various tasks, including in mathematical, algorithmic, or symbolic reasoning.

- AgentPrompting implements CoF for mathematical reasoning, specifically for the gsm8k dataset.
- ColoredObjectPrompting implements CoF for reasoning about the properties of objects.
- DatePrompting implements CoF for reasoning about calendar dates.
- LibraryCreationPrompting instructs the LLM to automatically create a library of functions for mathematical reasoning. It then implements CoF using this automatically generated library.
- MawpsPrompting implements CoF for mathematical reasoning, specifically for the mawps datasets.
- ObjectCountingPrompting implements CoF for the task of counting the number of a specific type of object.
- PenguinPrompting implements CoF for the task of reasoning about databases or tables of attributes.
- RepeatCopyPrompting implements CoF for the task of determining the appropriate output to an instruction such as "Repeat the word big 20 times".
- TableLibraryPrompting implements CoF for the task of reasoning about databases or tables of attributes.
- ToolPrompting implements CoF using multiple libraries for questions that require multiple domains of knowledge.
