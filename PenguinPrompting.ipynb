    "(1) CREATE_START[data]CREATE_END: CREATE takes a data definition of a table which will be used to generate a pandas dataframe, so make sure that the input does not contain anything unnecessary for the pandas dataframe input generation. Write the data in json format.\n",
    "(2) GET_VALUE_START[row_number;column]GET_VALUE_END: GET_VALUE takes the row_number, e.g., 0 is the 1st row of the table, and the name of a column, e.g., age, and returns the value of the cell, e.g., the age in the first row of the table.\n",
    "(3) COUNT_START[query]COUNT_END: COUNT takes a query and counts the number of entries in the table that satisfies the query. For example, COUNT_START[age > 5]COUNT_END would count the number of entries whose value in the column \"age\" is larger than 5.\n",
    "(4) FILTER_START[query]FILTER_END: FILTER takes a query, similarly to COUNT, and filters the entries in the table that satisfies the query. For example, FILTER_START[height < 13]FILTER_END would return the entries whose value in the column \"height\" is less than 13.\n",
    "(5) SORT_START[column]SORT_END: SORT takes the name of a column in the table and sorts the table based on the column in lexicographical/numerical order\n",
    "(6) ADD_START[row]ADD_END: ADD takes a row and adds it to the table. Write the data in json format. NOTE: This does not necessarily preserve any previous sorted order.\n",
    "(7) FINISH_START[answer]FINISH_END: When you finish the question, write your answer as FINISH_START[answer]FINISH_END and terminate your response.\n",
    "Terminate your response after an action. Then, an Observation is returned by the user. IMPORTANT: YOU DO NOT WRITE OBSERVATIONS. THEY WILL BE PROVIDED TO YOU. You will be given a question and you will perform Thoughts and Actions until you get the answer. When you get the answer, you will perform the Action called Finish. While you are reasoning out solutions, you will continually refer back to relevant portions of the question and employ logical reasoning to determine your next action.\n",
